          <span class="gridtxt"><b>Faster then the speed of light!:</b> Since the release of
            imadejptr, it has always
            been a rushed state because not only was it rushed to people, it was also not really thought out in design.
            The
            more that was added to the site, the more slower the site was. For V2, we made sure to speed up loading
            times
            and games too, making playing games on imadejptr easier then ever.</span>

          <span class="gridtxt"><b>More Customization!:</b> We have heard A LOT of complaints about
            the colors not
            being easy on the eyes. So, we made themes a priority when making V2. With a wide variety of themes to
            choose
            from, you can change the look of the website with just a click of a button!</span>
          <span class="gridtxt"><b>New Systems!:</b> We wanted to add something new to the
            website
            that adds more
            possiblities of what can be played on a game site. So we decided to add four new systems here on imadejptr!
            The Atari 2600, Sega Master System, Sega 32X, Sega Game Gear, and Playstation 1 are now all avaliable on IMJ
            V2!</span>

          <span class="gridtxt"><b>Ease of access:</b> No more cluster navigation bars. Instead, we
            offer a much
            easier way to access the games that you want to play. We want people from all over the internet to be able
            to
            access this website with ease and were hoping this will help the cause!</span>

        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          imadejptr is a game site that offers quality over quantity and clarity so you can get the games that YOU want
          to
          play. At imadejptr, here's what we strive for:</p>
        <hr>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li>1. <b>Quality Games:</b> Make sure that the games that people ask for are the best they possibly
            can
            be.
            This is done so
            we can stand out from other sites and have games that other sites would dream to have and what you guys
            would
            dream to play too.</li>
          <br>
          <li>2. <b>Clarity</b>: The unbelievable number of game sites that have games that are advertised as
            one
            thing
            but are
            something that is not only not what was advertised, but wasn't even at a level for it to be tolerable to
            play.
            Here at imadejptr, we make sure that this site not only advertises what is on the site, but it has the games
            and
            quality to live up to what is advertised on the site.</li>
          <br>
          <li>3. <b>Ease of use</b>: The best game sites are the ones where you just pick a game and play. We
            strive to
            make it as
            easy
            for anyone to play these games.</li>
          <br>
          <li>4. <b>Ad-free games</b>: Do you ever hate it when you go on a game site, and you play a game you
            wanna play
            but right
            when you start playing it, an un-skippable 30-second ad pops up and blocks your whole screen? Well, that
            would
            be
            fine if they would stop the game, but 9 times out of 10 they never stop the game so every time you play that
            game,
            you're losing and there is 0 point in playing it because of the ads. Here on imadejptr, we make sure when we
            get
            the games you want, we RIP the ads out of the games themselves, making it easier, faster, and less of a
            hassle
            to
            play the games that you wanna play without getting those stupid pop-ups.</li>
          <br>
          <li>5. <b>Updated Weekly</b>: Do you ever hate it when you go on a game site and you find a game that
            you
            wanna
            play, and
            you
            click on the said game and the game doesn't work or the link is dead and hasn't been updated since the
            dinosaurs
            were around? Well, we make sure that if there's something wrong with these games, we fix them and keep
            things
            accessible for everyone. So as long as this site is up, the updates will come.</li>
          <br>
          <li>6. <b>Community Input</b>: Here, we love to hear from you guys on any improvements you want on
            the
            site, any
            games you
            want on the site, or just participating in a community event. We put our focus not on the money, but on the
            community at large because that's the people that are playing on the site and the only reason why the
            website
            is
            relevant.</li>
          <br>
          <li>7. <b>Unblocked Tested</b>: Almost all the games are unblocked tested so if anyone is "doing
            their
            homework", they will
            be able to do so at school.</li>
          <br>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p>
          From a website that first started as an experiment to play games at school to pushing the boundaries of what's
          possible on a game site. This is imadejptr.
